// Week 06 Card Game coding assignment
//
// Coding Steps:
//
// For the final project you will be creating an automated version of the classic card game WAR! 
// There are many versions of the game WAR. In this version there are only 2 players.
// You do not need to do anything special when there is a tie in a round.
// Think about how you would build this project and write your plan down. 
// Consider classes such as: Card, Deck, Player, as well as what properties and methods they may include. 
// You do not need to accept any user input, when you run your code, the entire game 
//  should play out instantly without any user input inside of your browser‚Äôs console.
//
// The completed project should, when executed, do the following:
//
// Deal 26 Cards to each Player from a Deck of 52 cards.
// Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card.
// The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point
// Ties result in zero points for both Players
// After all cards have been played, display the score and declare the winner.
// Write a Unit Test using Mocha and Chai for at least one of the functions you write.

// Card anatomy: NumValue (2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10), Suits (heart, diamond, spade, clubs), Face 
//     - not needed(Back, Boarder, Finish, Stock)
// Deck: has 52 cards split evenly between 2 players(26 each), 
// Dealer: shuffles and deals cards


              // card Values help determine which player hand played the higher value card
